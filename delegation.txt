== Delegation ==
What is delegation? Delegation is assigning responsibility and authority to someone in order to complete a clearly defined and agreed upon task while we retain ultimate responsibility for its success. There are 2 key points about delegation: 1. the delegated task should be clearly defined and agreed; 2. even the task is handled by others, we still take the ultimate responsibility for its success.
Why should we delegate?
Delegation benefits us. It saves our time if we delegate tasks to our team members who are able to complete the tasks. After delegating, our stress is relieved and we have more time to do our job. And we have more time to look for more challenging tasks to increase the value of our activities.
Delegation also benefits our team members. While delegating, we teach our team members new skills and they have the opportunities to develop themselves. When we give a teammate a task, it shows that we have trust and confidence in him or her. And then, our teammates' self-esteem is raised and it can motivate them. As our teammates have the responsibility and authority of the task, they can have new ideas and solutions to problems that we may not recognize before. This can enhance our jobs effectively.
Our teams also get benefits from delegation. In delegation, we need to explain the purpose of the task, and it helps our teammates understand the team's objectives. It also can motivate our team members. Team members share their skills around the team and increase the skills of everyone. So if one member falls ill, another could help to handle the task. Teamwork and communication can be improved with delegation. When we delegate effectively, we can make sure that everyone's workloads are equally balanced. 
So we should take delegation into consideration at our daily work.
