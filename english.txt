Donation Letter
Dear Sir,
What I am writing is to ask for your assistance to build schools in Guangdong mountains.
In north Guangdong mountaints, thousands of children do not have a chance to education. Because they live far away from cities and no school is built in mountaints.
We're aiming to help every child in Guangdong mountaints to go to shool, we know that as parents, aunts, uncles and proud citizens you'll want to help too. It is our goal to build schools in mountaints for the children in Guangdong.
Please consider making a donation to help the children. Thank ou very much for your time and consideration.
Yours faithfully

Mr Walter Yu, HSBC

Refuse Donation Letter
Dear Sir,
We recently received your request for donations to buid schools in Guangdong mountains.
We agree that this is a very good cause, but unfortunately we will not be able to help this year. Because our company has already contributed to several charitable organizations this year and our funds are depleted.
Please contact us before the end of February of next year, we will be a better position to consider your application.
We wish you much success in this worthy cause. 

Yours faithfully
Jay Yu
