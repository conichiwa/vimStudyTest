=== Investment ===
The purpose of this presentation is to introduce a way of investment.
First of all, what is investment? Investment is to invest is to allocate money (or sometimes another resource, such as time) in the expectation of some benefit in the future. So time is a kind of resource that we could use to invest. And time is fair to everyone: 24 hours per day. If we spare 90 minutes every day to invest, we will have about 23 days per year. So we could do a lot of things with such a long time.
So, where should we invest our time? Learning English is one of the best things to invest; Because English is the most commonly used language among foreign language speakers. Throughout the world, when people with different languages come together they commonly use English to communicate. And as we work at HSBC, speaking English fluently helps us to communicate with our clients and users very well. It also helps us to make a good relationship with them. The better the relationship is, the higher performance you can achieve. This will help us improve our career path. Learning to speak English well may be the best thing you can do to improve your life. We will get the great return from learning English.
Finally, I want to talk about how to do investment. As time is the resource we use to invest, we could do the investment anytime, anywhere. We can listen to the English audio files on our way to office. We can study some phrasal verb slips on subway or bus. And we can practice English at work: Speak English to colleagues. We can read some English books or materials before sleep. I believe these won't take you so much time. If you spend 90 minutes, you will spend 23 days on English, and your English will be much better. For the other skills, it is similar to English. The more time you spend on, the better you will be.
To be summarized, time is the best resource to do investment and we will benefit most from learning English. Let's start investing our time on learning English.
